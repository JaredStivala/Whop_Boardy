# Authentication
Source: https://dev.whop.com/api-reference/graphql/authentication

An overview of authentication methods for the Whop API

All calls on Whop are made on behalf of a user, and a company ID if applicable, as followed below.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript get-user.ts
  export const whopApi = WhopApi({
    appApiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY ?? "fallback",
    onBehalfOfUserId: 'YOUR_USER_OR_AN_AGENT_USER',
    companyId: undefined,
  });

  // fetch another user

  await whopApi.FetchPublicUser({ userId: winningUser })
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You are able to make calls on behalf of any user using your app.


# Examples
Source: https://dev.whop.com/api-reference/graphql/examples



Here are some useful queries and their implementations to get you started in Next.JS, Swift, or Python:

### Get messages from a direct message feed

```graphql
query DmsFeedData($feedId: ID!, $postsLimit: Int!) {
  dmsFeedData(feedId: $feedId, postsLimit: $postsLimit) {
    posts {
      content
      user {
        username
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Get current user information

```graphql
query myCurrentUser {
  viewer {
    user {
      id
      username
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

### Send chat message

```graphql
mutation SendMessage($input: SendMessageInput!) {
  sendMessage(input: $input)
}
```

### Create a forum post

```graphql
mutation CreateForumPost($input: CreateForumPostInput!) {
  createForumPost(input: $input) {
    # You can specify return fields here if needed
  }
}
```

### Get whops from discover

```graphql
query DiscoverySearch($query: String!) {
  discoverySearch(query: $query) {
    accessPasses {
      title
      route
      headline
      logo {
        sourceUrl
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Implementation Examples

### Python (using requests)

```python
import requests

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "x-on-behalf-of": "user_123",
    "x-company-id": "biz_123",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Example: Fetching DMs
full_query = """query DmsFeedData($feedId: ID!, $postsLimit: Int!) {
    dmsFeedData(feedId: $feedId, postsLimit: $postsLimit) {
        posts {
            content
            user {
                username
                id
            }
        }
    }
}"""

payload = {
    "query": full_query,
    "variables": {
        "feedId": "your_feed_id",
        "postsLimit": 1
    }
}

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.whop.com/public-graphql",
    headers=headers,
    json=payload
)
response_json = response.json()
```

### Next.js (using Apollo Client)

```typescript
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, createHttpLink } from "@apollo/client";
import { setContext } from "@apollo/client/link/context";
import { gql } from "@apollo/client";

// Create HTTP link
const httpLink = createHttpLink({
  uri: "https://api.whop.com/public-graphql",
});

// Add auth headers
const authLink = setContext((_, { headers }) => {
  return {
    headers: {
      ...headers,
      authorization: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`,
      "x-on-behalf-of": "user_123",
      "x-company-id": "biz_123",
    },
  };
});

// Create Apollo Client
const client = new ApolloClient({
  link: authLink.concat(httpLink),
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

// Example: Discovery Search
const DISCOVERY_SEARCH = gql`
  query DiscoverySearch($query: String!) {
    discoverySearch(query: $query) {
      accessPasses {
        title
        route
        headline
        logo {
          sourceUrl
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;

// Usage
client
  .query({
    query: DISCOVERY_SEARCH,
    variables: { query: "search_term" },
  })
  .then((result) => console.log(result));
```

### Swift (using Apollo iOS)

```swift
import Apollo

// Configure Apollo Client
let url = URL(string: "https://api.whop.com/public-graphql")!

let store = ApolloStore()
let transport = RequestChainNetworkTransport(
    interceptorProvider: DefaultInterceptorProvider(store: store),
    endpointURL: url,
    additionalHeaders: [
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
        "x-on-behalf-of": "user_123",
        "x-company-id": "biz_123"
    ]
)

let client = ApolloClient(networkTransport: transport, store: store)

// Example: Get Current User
let getCurrentUser = """
query myCurrentUser {
  viewer {
    user {
      id
      username
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
"""

client.fetch(query: getCurrentUser) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let graphQLResult):
        print("Success! Result: \(graphQLResult)")
    case .failure(let error):
        print("Failure! Error: \(error)")
    }
}
```

These examples demonstrate basic usage of the Whop GraphQL API across different platforms. Remember to replace placeholder values (YOUR\_API\_KEY, user\_123, etc.) with your actual credentials.


# Rate Limits
Source: https://dev.whop.com/api-reference/graphql/rate-limits



## Overview

The Whop GraphQL API enforces rate limits to ensure fair usage and system stability.

## Current Limits

```http
10 requests per 10 seconds
```

## Query Complexity Limits

In addition to request rate limits, the GraphQL API enforces query complexity limits:

* **Max Complexity**: 1000
* **Max Depth**: 10

These limits help prevent overly complex or deeply nested queries that could impact performance.
If you encounter these errors, you'll need to break your requests into smaller queries.

Learn more about query complexity and depth here: [https://www.howtographql.com/advanced/4-security/](https://www.howtographql.com/advanced/4-security/)

## Handling Rate Limits

If you exceed the rate limit, the API will respond with a `429 Too Many Requests` status code.
When this happens, it's best to wait until the rate limit window resets before making additional requests.

## Best Practices

* Implement exponential backoff for retries
* Cache responses when possible
* Batch GraphQL operations into fewer requests


# Schema
Source: https://dev.whop.com/api-reference/graphql/schema



## Why GraphQL

GraphQL is an API interface (alternative to REST) that allows for rapid development and iterative changes to evolving objects.
Whop has built its core product and internal APIs using GraphQL for years, and is now exposing most of the same functionality
via a publicly accessible version.

## Available endpoints

You can explore all available queries and mutations using our Apollo OS explorer:

üîó [GraphQL Explorer](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/whop-public-gql/variant/current/explorer)

To make a call, you must pass the following headers:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_APP_API_KEY
x-on-behalf-of: user_1NqS34mOp24
x-company-id: biz_Nq4S34mfp59
Content-Type: application/json
```

| Header           | Description                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Authorization`  | Get from [here](/what-to-build/agentic-businesses#step-1%3A-create-your-app). Must be prefixed with "Bearer". |
| `x-on-behalf-of` | Specifies the User ID of the account you're making requests on behalf of.                                     |
| `x-company-id`   | Specifies the Biz ID to target the business of a user you are calling from.                                   |
| `Content-Type`   | Specifies the format of the request payload as JSON.                                                          |

#### Who can you make requests on behalf of?

Your app can make calls on behalf of users in three ways. Any of these methods grant full access to automating the user's account:

* The User is the original creator of the organization in which your app was created (Ex. your own User ID)
* The User is an Agent User created by the app [here](/what-to-build/agentic-businesses#step-1%3A-create-your-app)
* The User has joined a whop that has installed your app

## API Capabilities

This GraphQL API provides **powerful** access to the entire Whop ecosystem, allowing developers to build sophisticated integrations and applications. Through the API, you can access and manipulate all core Whop functionality, including:

* User management
* Store and product handling
* Messages, forum posts, and live streams

## Development Status

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**: This API is still under active development.

While we strive to maintain backward compatibility, some features may be added, modified, or removed

We recommend checking our changelog regularly for updates and announcements about API changes.


# Embed checkout (coming soon)
Source: https://dev.whop.com/features/checkout-embed

Learn how to embed Whop's checkout flow on your website

Embedded checkout allows you to embed Whop's checkout flow on your own website in two easy steps. This allows you to offer your users a seamless checkout experience without leaving your website.

## Step 1: Add the script tag

To embed checkout, you need to add the following script tag into the `<head>` of your page:

```md
<script
  async
  defer
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@whop/checkout@0.0.21-canary.8/dist/loader.js"
></script>
```

## Step 2: Add the checkout element

To create a checkout element, you need to include the following attribute on an element in your page:

```md
<div data-whop-checkout-plan-id="plan_XXXXXXXXX"></div>
```

This will now mount an iframe inside of the element with the plan id you provided. Once the checkout is complete, the user will be redirected to the redirect url you specified in the settings on Whop.

You can configure the redirect url in your [whop's settings](https://whop.com/dashboard/whops/) or in your [company's settings](https://whop.com/dashboard/settings/checkout/) on the dashboard. If both are specified, the redirect url specified in the whop's settings will take precedence.

## Available attributes

### **`data-whop-checkout-plan-id`**

**Required** - The plan id you want to checkout.

> To get your plan id, you need to first create a plan in the **Manage Pricing** section on your whop page.

### **`data-whop-checkout-theme`**

**Optional** - The theme you want to use for the checkout.

Possible values are `light`, `dark` or `system`.

```md
<div data-whop-checkout-theme="light" data-whop-checkout-plan-id="plan_XXXXXXXXX"></div>
```

### **`data-whop-checkout-session-id`**

**Optional** - The session id to use for the checkout.

This can be used to attach metadata to a checkout by first creating a session through the API and then passing the session id to the checkout element.

```md
<div data-whop-checkout-session-id="ch_XXXXXXXXX" data-whop-checkout-plan-id="plan_XXXXXXXXX"></div>
```

## Full example

```md
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
		<script
			async
			defer
			src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@whop/checkout@0.0.21-canary.8/dist/loader.js"
		></script>
		<title>Whop embedded checkout example</title>
		<style>
			div {
				box-sizing: border-box;
			}
			body {
				margin: 0
			}
		</style>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div
			data-whop-checkout-plan-id="plan_XXXXXXXXX"
			data-whop-checkout-session-id="ch_XXXXXXXXX"
			data-whop-checkout-theme="light"
			style="height: fit-content; overflow: hidden; max-width: 50%;"
		></div>
	</body>

# Payments and payouts
Source: https://dev.whop.com/features/payments-and-payouts

Use the API to collect payment from users or payout users.

## Collecting Payments

First, create the charge on the server using the Whop API. Then you can either:

1. Open a modal in your app using the iframe SDK (recommended)
2. Redirect the user to Whop's checkout page

### 1. Create the charge on the server

> This step will create a charge on the server and return the inAppPurchase object required for the next step.

On the server, use the [chargeUser](/sdk/api/payments/charge-user) method to create a charge:

```typescript app/api/charge/route.ts
import { whopApi } from "@/lib/whop-api";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  try {
    const { userId, experienceId } = await request.json();

    const result = await whopApi.chargeUser({
      input: {
        amount: 100,
        currency: "usd",
        userId: userId,
        // metadata is information that you'd like to receive later about the payment.
        metadata: {
          creditsToPurchase: 1,
          experienceId: experienceId,
        },
      },
    });

    if (!result.chargeUser?.inAppPurchase) {
      throw new Error("Failed to create charge");
    }

    return Response.json(result.chargeUser.inAppPurchase);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error creating charge:", error);
    return Response.json({ error: "Failed to create charge" }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

### 2. Confirm the payment on the client

> In this step the user will be prompted to confirm the previously created charge in a modal.

<Warning>
  This function requires the iFrame SDK to be initialized. See [**iFrame
  Overview**](/sdk/iframe-setup) for more information.
</Warning>

Use the iframe SDK to open a payment modal:

<CodeGroup>
  ```tsx React
  "use client";
  import { useIframeSdk } from "@whop/react";

  export default function PaymentButton({
    userId,
    experienceId,
  }: {
    userId: string;
    experienceId: string;
  }) {
    const iframeSdk = useIframeSdk();
    
    const [receiptId, setReceiptId] = useState<string>();
    const [error, setError] = useState<string>();
    
    async function handlePurchase() {
      try {
        // 1. Create charge on server
        const response = await fetch("/api/charge", {
          method: "POST",
          body: JSON.stringify({ userId, experienceId }),
        });
        
        if (response.ok) {
          const inAppPurchase = await response.json();
          // 2. Open payment modal
          const res = await iframeSdk.inAppPurchase(inAppPurchase);
          
          if (res.status === "ok") {
            setReceiptId(res.data.receipt_id);
            setError(undefined);
          } else {
            setReceiptId(undefined);
            setError(res.error);
          }
        } else {
          throw new Error("Failed to create charge");
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Purchase failed:", error);
        setError("Purchase failed");
      }
    }
    
    return <button onClick={handlePurchase}>Purchase Plan</button>;
  }
  ```

  ```tsx Vanilla JS
  import { iframeSdk } from "@/lib/iframe-sdk";

  const paymentButton = document.querySelector("button#payment-button");
  const receiptElement = document.querySelector("span#receiptContainer");
  const errorElement = document.querySelector("span#errorContainer");

  function setError(error?: string) {
    if (errorElement instanceof HTMLSpanElement) {
      errorElement.textContent = error ?? "";
    }
  }

  function setReceiptId(receiptId?: string) {
    if (receiptElement instanceof HTMLSpanElement) {
      receiptElement.textContent = receiptId ?? "";
    }
  }

  if (paymentButton instanceof HTMLButtonElement) {
    paymentButton.addEventListener(
      "click",
      async function onPaymentButtonClick() {
        const userId = this.dataset.userId;
        const experienceId = this.dataset.experienceId;
        if (!userId || !experienceId) {
          throw new Error("Missing userId or experienceId");
        }

        try {
          // 1. Create charge on server
          const response = await fetch("/api/charge", {
            method: "POST",
            body: JSON.stringify({ userId, experienceId }),
          });

          if (response.ok) {
            const inAppPurchase = await response.json();
            // 2. Open payment modal
            const res = await iframeSdk.inAppPurchase(inAppPurchase);

            if (res.status === "ok") {
              setReceiptId(res.data.receipt_id);
              setError(undefined);
            } else {
              setReceiptId(undefined);
              setError(res.error);
            }
          } else {
            throw new Error("Failed to create charge");
          }
        } catch (error) {
          console.error("Purchase failed:", error);
          setError("Purchase failed");
        }
      }
    );
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Sending Payouts

You can send payouts to any user using their Whop username. The funds will be transferred from your company's ledger account.

### Transfer Funds

```typescript
import { whopApi } from "@/lib/whop-api";

async function sendPayout(
  companyId: string,
  recipientUsername: string,
  amount: number
) {
  // 1. Get your company's ledger account
  const experience = await whopApi.getExperience({ experienceId });
  const companyId = experience.experience.company.id;
  const ledgerAccount = await whopApi.getCompanyLedgerAccount({ companyId });

  // 2. Pay the recipient
  await whopApi.payUser({
    input: {
      amount: amount,
      currency: "usd",
      // Username or ID or ledger account ID of the recipient user
      destinationId: recipientUsername,
      // Your company's ledger account ID that can be retrieve from whopApi.getCompanyLedgerAccount()
      ledgerAccountId: ledgerAccount.company?.ledgerAccount.id!,
      // Optional transfer fee in percentage
      transferFee: ledgerAccount.company?.ledgerAccount.transferFee,
    },
  });
}
```


# Create forum post
Source: https://dev.whop.com/features/post-to-feed

Create a forum and a post using the API

## Overview

To post in a forum, you must:

1. Find or create a *Forum Experience*
2. Create a *Forum Post* inside the *Forum Experience*

<Info>
  If you already know what forum experience you want to post in, you can skip
  step 1, and use the experience ID directly in step 2.
</Info>

***

## Find or create a forum experience

A forum post must be created within a **Forum Experience**.
The `findOrCreateForum` method will find an existing forum experience with the specified name,
or create a new one with all the specified options

```typescript
 const newForum = await whopApi.withUser("YOUR_AGENT_USER_ID").findOrCreateForum({
    input: {
      experienceId: experienceId,
      name: "Dino game results",
      whoCanPost: "admins",
		// optional:
		// expiresAt: Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
		// price: {
        // baseCurrency: "usd",
        // initialPrice: 100,
      // }
    },
  });
```

> This will create the forum in the same whop as the supplied experience.

***

## Create a forum post.

Once you have the `experienceId` from the above, use it to create a post.

### Basic Forum Post

```ts
const forumPost = await whopApi
  .withUser("YOUR_AGENT_USER_ID")
  .createForumPost({
    input: {
      forumExperienceId: newForum.createForum?.id,
      title: "Welcome!",
      content: "Excited to kick things off in our new forum üéâ",
    },
  });
```

* `withUser()`: ID of the user posting
* `forumExperienceId`: The ID of the target forum
* `title` and `content`: Main post body. *(title is optional)*

### Forum post with advanced options

This demonstrates a rich post using all features:

```ts
const forumPost = await whopApi
  .withUser("YOUR_AGENT_USER_ID")
  .createForumPost({
    input: {
      forumExperienceId: "exp_XXXXXX",
      // Visible even before purchase.
      title: "Big Launch + Community Poll!",
      // Visible only after purchase
      content: "Hidden content unless purchased. üîí",
      // Add media to the post.
      // Learn how to upload in the upload-media section
      attachments: [
        {
          directUploadId: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
        },
      ],

      // Do not send a notification to everyone about this post.
      isMention: false,

      // Lock the content and attachments behind a
      // one time purchase in the price + currency.
      paywallAmount: 9.99,
      paywallCurrency: "usd",

      // Add a poll to the post.
      poll: {
        options: [
          { id: "1", text: "New Product Features" },
          { id: "2", text: "Exclusive AMA" },
          { id: "3", text: "Member Giveaways" },
        ],
      },
    },
  });
```


# Send push notification
Source: https://dev.whop.com/features/send-push-notification

Send a push notification to a user or a group of users.

```typescript
import { whopApi } from "@/lib/whop-api";

const input = {
  experienceId: "exp_XYZ", // Or userId to send to one specific user.
  title: "Important Update",
  message: "Your new content is now available!",
  // url: "https://example.com/new-content" If blank (recommended, users will be brought to your app view.)
};


const success = (await whopApi.sendNotification({input})).sendNotification;

if (success) {
	console.log("Notification sent successfully.");
} else {
	console.log("Failed to send notification or it's being processed.");
}

```


# Upload media
Source: https://dev.whop.com/features/upload-media

Use Whop to upload images, videos, audio, and other files.

### Client-Side: Set up the Image Upload Component

First, create a component to handle image uploads. This example uses `react-dropzone` for the file upload interface.

```typescript
import { useState, useCallback, useEffect } from "react";
import { useDropzone } from "react-dropzone";

function ImageUploader() {
  // Set up state for the image file and preview
  const [image, setImage] = useState<{
    file: File;
    preview: string;
  } | null>(null);

  // Clean up object URLs when component unmounts
  useEffect(() => {
    const objectUrl = image?.preview;
    if (objectUrl) {
      return () => {
        URL.revokeObjectURL(objectUrl);
      };
    }
  }, [image?.preview]);

  // Handle file drops
  const onDrop = useCallback((acceptedFiles: File[]) => {
    const file = acceptedFiles[0];
    if (file) {
      setImage({
        file,
        preview: URL.createObjectURL(file),
      });
    }
  }, []);

  // Configure dropzone
  const { getRootProps, getInputProps, isDragActive } = useDropzone({
    onDrop,
    accept: {
      "image/*": [".jpeg", ".jpg", ".png", ".gif"],
    },
    maxFiles: 1,
  });

  return (
    <div {...getRootProps()} className="border-2 border-dashed rounded-lg p-8">
      <input {...getInputProps()} />
      {image?.preview ? (
        <img src={image.preview} alt="Preview" className="max-w-full h-auto" />
      ) : (
        <p>Drag & drop an image here, or click to select</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Server-Side: Handle File Uploads

Create an API route to handle the file upload using the Whop SDK:

```typescript
import { verifyUserToken, whopApi } from "@/lib/whop-api";
import { headers } from "next/headers";
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  try {
    // Verify user authentication
    const headersList = await headers();
    const userToken = await verifyUserToken(headersList);
    if (!userToken) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
    }

    // Get the file from the request
    const file = await request.blob();
    
    // Upload to Whop
    const response = await whopApi.uploadAttachment({
      file: new File([file], `upload-${Date.now()}.png`, {
        type: "image/png",
      }),
      record: "forum_post", // or other record types
    });

    // The response includes the directUploadId and URL
    return NextResponse.json({
      success: true,
      attachmentId: response.directUploadId,
      url: response.attachment.source.url
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error uploading file:", error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: "Failed to upload file" },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}
```

### Using Uploaded Media

After uploading, you can use the attachment ID in various Whop features. For example, to create a forum post with the uploaded image (server-side):

```typescript
const createForumPost = async (attachmentId: string) => {
  const post = await whopApi.createForumPost({
    input: {
      forumExperienceId: "your-forum-id",
      content: "Check out this image!",
      attachments: [
        { directUploadId: attachmentId }
      ]
    }
  });

  return post;
}
```

### Supported File Types

The Whop API supports the following file types for upload:

* Images: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`
* Videos: `.mp4`, `.mov`
* Documents: `.pdf`

### Best Practices

1. **File Size**: Keep uploads under 100MB for optimal performance
2. **Image Optimization**: Consider using libraries like `sharp` for image processing before upload
3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling on both client and server
4. **Clean Up**: Remember to clean up any preview URLs to prevent memory leaks
5. **Security**: Always verify user authentication before handling uploads
6. **Progress Tracking**: Consider implementing upload progress tracking for better UX

### Complete Example

Here's a complete example showing both client and server integration:

```typescript
// app/components/MediaUploader.tsx (Client)
import { useState, useCallback, useEffect } from "react";
import { useDropzone } from "react-dropzone";

export default function MediaUploader() {
  const [image, setImage] = useState<{
    file: File;
    preview: string;
  } | null>(null);
  const [isUploading, setIsUploading] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
      if (image?.preview) {
        URL.revokeObjectURL(image.preview);
      }
    };
  }, [image]);

  const onDrop = useCallback((acceptedFiles: File[]) => {
    const file = acceptedFiles[0];
    if (file) {
      setImage({
        file,
        preview: URL.createObjectURL(file),
      });
    }
  }, []);

  const { getRootProps, getInputProps } = useDropzone({
    onDrop,
    accept: {
      "image/*": [".jpeg", ".jpg", ".png", ".gif"],
    },
    maxFiles: 1,
  });

  const handleUpload = async () => {
    if (!image?.file) return;
    
    setIsUploading(true);
    try {
      // Send to your API route
      const formData = new FormData();
      formData.append("file", image.file);
      
      const response = await fetch("/api/upload", {
        method: "POST",
        body: formData,
      });
      
      const data = await response.json();
      
      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(data.error);
      }

      // Clear the form after successful upload
      setImage(null);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Upload failed:", error);
    } finally {
      setIsUploading(false);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <div {...getRootProps()} className="border-2 border-dashed rounded-lg p-8">
        <input {...getInputProps()} />
        {image?.preview ? (
          <img src={image.preview} alt="Preview" className="max-w-full h-auto" />
        ) : (
          <p>Drag & drop an image here, or click to select</p>
        )}
      </div>

      {image && (
        <button
          onClick={handleUpload}
          disabled={isUploading}
          className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded"
        >
          {isUploading ? "Uploading..." : "Upload"}
        </button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation provides a complete media upload solution with:

* Drag and drop interface
* File preview
* Upload handling

# Connect to websocket
Source: https://dev.whop.com/features/websocket-guide

Learn how to implement real-time features using Whop's websocket API

You can connect to the websocket from your client side frontend code running in the iFrame.

1. Create the websocket client:

   ```typescript
   import { WhopClientSdk } from "@whop/api";

   const whopApi = WhopClientSdk();

   const websocket = whopApi.websocketClient({
     joinExperience: "exp_XXXX", // optional, you can join a specific experience channel (ie, the one you are currently viewing).
     joinCustom: "some_custom_channel", // optional, you can join a custom channel.
   });
   ```

2. Add event handlers for messages:

   ```typescript
   websocket.on("appMessage", (message) => {
     console.log("Received custom message:", message);

     // message.isTrusted is true if and only if the message was sent from your server with your private app API key.

     // message.json is the JSON string you sent from your server / client.

     // if you sent the message from the client using websocket.broadcast,
     // message.fromUserId will include the user id of the user who sent the message.
   });
   ```

3. Handle connection status changes:

   ```typescript
   websocket.on("connectionStatus", (status) => {
     console.log("Websocket Status Updated:", status);
   });

   websocket.on("connect", () => {
     console.log("Websocket Connected");
   });

   websocket.on("disconnect", () => {
     console.log("Websocket Disconnected");
   });
   ```

4. Connect to the websocket and start receiving events:

   ```typescript
   websocket.connect();
   ```

5. *Optional:* Disconnect from the websocket:

   ```typescript
   websocket.disconnect();
   ```

## Send messages from the client

You can send messages from the client to the server by using the `websocket.broadcast` function.

1. Create a websocket client as above, and make sure you are connected by calling `websocket.connect()`.

2. Send a custom message via websocket.

   ```typescript
   websocket.broadcast({
     message: JSON.stringify({ hello: "world" }),
     target: "everyone",
   });
   ```

   The target field is the same as the one you would pass to `whopApi.sendWebsocketMessage` on the server.

## Send messages from your server

You can broadcast trusted websocket messages from your server to connected clients by using the `whopApi.sendWebsocketMessage` function.

1. Construct an instance of the whop server sdk and pass your API key:

   ```typescript
   import { WhopServerSdk } from "@whop/api";

   const whopApi = WhopServerSdk({
     appApiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY,
   });
   ```

2. Send a custom string message via websocket.

   ```typescript
   // Send to all users currently on your app across all experiences / views.
   whopApi.sendWebsocketMessage({
     message: JSON.stringify({ hello: "world" }),
     target: "everyone",
   });

   // send to all users currently on this experience
   // (only works if the experience belongs to your app)
   whopApi.sendWebsocketMessage({
     message: JSON.stringify({ hello: "world" }),
     target: { experience: "exp_XXXX" },
   });

   // create a custom channel that your websocket client can subscribe to.
   // Only works if when connecting on the client, you pass the same custom channel name.
   whopApi.sendWebsocketMessage({
     message: JSON.stringify({ hello: "world" }),
     target: { custom: "some_custom_channel" },
   });

   // send to a specific user on your app
   whopApi.sendWebsocketMessage({
     message: JSON.stringify({ hello: "world" }),
     target: { user: "user_XXXX" },
   });
   ```

## Receive messages on your server

<Info>
  Before you start, make sure you are using NodeJS 22.4 or higher, or Bun to run
  your server.
</Info>

Use the server websocket API to receive events such as chat messages as forum posts for a particular user on your server.
You can use these events to build real-time apps such as chat bots and AI-agents that react to events on the platform.

1. Construct (or reuse) an instance of the whop server sdk and pass your API key:

   ```typescript
   import { WhopServerSdk } from "@whop/api";

   const whopApi = WhopServerSdk({
     appApiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY,
   });
   ```

2. Create your websocket client and add handlers for messages / status changes:

   ```typescript
   const websocket = whopApi
     // Pass the user id of the user you want to receive events for
     .withUser("user_v9KUoZvTGp6ID")
     // Construct the websocket client
     .websocketClient();
   ```

3. Add event handlers for messages:

   ```typescript
   websocket.on("message", (message) => {
     console.log("Received Message:", message);

     const chatMessage = message.feedEntity?.dmsPost;
     if (chatMessage) {
       // handle the chat message
     }

     const forumPost = message.feedEntity?.forumPost;
     if (forumPost) {
       // handle the forum post
     }
   });
   ```

4. Add event handlers for status changes (same as client API):

   ```typescript
   websocket.on("connectionStatus", (status) => {
     console.log("Websocket Status Updated:", status);
   });

   // Or you can also listen to the connect and disconnect events:
   websocket.on("connect", () => {
     console.log("Websocket Connected");
   });

   websocket.on("disconnect", () => {
     console.log("Websocket Disconnected");
   });
   ```

5. Connect to the websocket and start receiving events:

   ```typescript
   websocket.connect();
   ```

6. *Optional:* Disconnect from the websocket:

   ```typescript
   websocket.disconnect();
   ```

## React Example

You can use the `WhopWebsocketProvider` component to wrap your app and provide the websocket client and status to your components.

```typescript my-app.tsx
"use client";

import type { proto } from "@whop/api";
import { useCallback, useState } from "react";
import {
  WhopWebsocketProvider,
  useWebsocket,
  useWebsocketStatus,
} from "./websocket-provider";

export function MyApp({ experienceId }: { experienceId: string }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState("");

  const onAppMessage = useCallback((message: proto.common.AppMessage) => {
    setMessage(message.json);
  }, []);

  return (
    <WhopWebsocketProvider
      joinExperience={experienceId}
      onAppMessage={onAppMessage}
    >
      <div>{message}</div>
      <ComponentThatSendsMessages />
      <ComponentThatDisplaysConnectionStatus />
    </WhopWebsocketProvider>
  );
}

function ComponentThatSendsMessages() {
  const websocket = useWebsocket();

  function handleClick() {
    websocket.broadcast({ message: "Hello, world!", target: "everyone" });
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button type="button" onClick={handleClick}>
        Send Message
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

function ComponentThatDisplaysConnectionStatus() {
  const status = useWebsocketStatus();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Connection Status: {status}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```typescript websocket-provider.tsx
"use client";

import {
  type WebsocketStatus,
  WhopClientSdk,
  type WhopWebsocketClientBrowser,
  type proto,
} from "@whop/api";
import {
  type PropsWithChildren,
  createContext,
  use,
  useEffect,
  useState,
} from "react";

const whopApi = WhopClientSdk();
const WebsocketContext = createContext<WhopWebsocketClientBrowser>(
  whopApi.websocketClient({})
);
const WebsocketStatusContext = createContext<WebsocketStatus>("disconnected");

export function useWebsocket() {
  return use(WebsocketContext);
}

export function useWebsocketStatus() {
  const status = use(WebsocketStatusContext);
  return status;
}

export function WhopWebsocketProvider({
  children,
  joinCustom,
  joinExperience,
  onAppMessage,
}: PropsWithChildren<{
  joinCustom?: string;
  joinExperience?: string;
  onAppMessage: (message: proto.common.AppMessage) => void;
}>) {
  const [websocket, setWebsocket] = useState<WhopWebsocketClientBrowser>(() =>
    whopApi.websocketClient({})
  );

  const [connectionStatus, setConnectionStatus] =
    useState<WebsocketStatus>("disconnected");

  useEffect(() => {
    const websocket = whopApi.websocketClient({
      joinCustom,
      joinExperience,
    });
    setWebsocket(websocket);
    websocket.on("connectionStatus", setConnectionStatus);
    return websocket.connect();
  }, [joinExperience, joinCustom]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (websocket) {
      websocket.on("appMessage", onAppMessage);
      return () => {
        websocket.off("appMessage", onAppMessage);
      };
    }
  }, [onAppMessage, websocket]);

  return (
    <WebsocketContext.Provider value={websocket}>
      <WebsocketStatusContext.Provider value={connectionStatus}>
        {children}
      </WebsocketStatusContext.Provider>
    </WebsocketContext.Provider>
  );
}
```
